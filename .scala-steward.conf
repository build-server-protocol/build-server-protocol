# pullRequests.frequency allows to control how often or when Scala Steward
# is allowed to create pull requests.
#
# Possible values:
#   @asap
#     PRs are created without delay.
#
#   <timespan>
#     PRs are created only again after the given timespan since the last PR
#     has passed. Example values are "36 hours", "1 day", or "14 days".

#   <CRON expression>
#     PRs are created roughly according to the given CRON expression.
#
#     CRON expressions consist of five fields:
#     minutes, hour of day, day of month, month, and day of week.
#
#     See https://www.alonsodomin.me/cron4s/userguide/index.html#parsing for
#     more information about the CRON expressions that are supported.
#
#     Note that the date parts of the CRON expression are matched exactly
#     while the time parts are only used to abide to the frequency of
#     the given expression.
#
# Default: @asap
#
#pullRequests.frequency = "0 0 ? * 3" # every thursday on midnight
pullRequests.frequency = "0 0 1 * *" # At 12:00 AM, on day 1 of the month - to match dependabot `monthly` schedule

# pullRequests.grouping allows you to specify how Scala Steward should group
# your updates in order to reduce the number of pull-requests.
#
# Updates will be placed in the first group with which they match, starting
# from the first in the array. Those that do not match any group will follow
# the default procedure (one PR per update).
#
# Each element in the array will have the following schema:
#
#   - name (mandatory): the name of the group, will be used for things like naming the branch
#   - title (optional): if provided it will be used as the title for the PR
#   - filter (mandatory): a non-empty list containing the filters to use to know
#                         if an update falls into this group.
#
# `filter` properties would have this format:
#
#    {
#       version = "major" | "minor" | "patch" | "pre-release" | "build-metadata",
#       group = "{group}",
#       artifact = "{artifact}"
#    }
#
# For more information on the values for the `version` filter visit https://semver.org/
#
# Every field in a `filter` is optional but at least one must be provided.
#
# For grouping every update together a filter like {group = "*"} can be # provided.
#
# To create a new PR for each unique combination of artifact-versions, include ${hash} in the name.
#
# Default: []
pullRequests.grouping = [
  { name = "major", "title" = "Major updates", "filter" = [ {"version" = "major"}] },
  { name = "all", "title" = "Dependency updates", "filter" = [{"group" = "*"}] }
]

# Only these dependencies which match the given patterns are updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, and may have `artifactId` and `version`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will update all dependencies.
#updates.allow  = [ { groupId = "com.example" } ]

# The dependencies which match the given version pattern are updated.
# Dependencies that are not listed will be updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, `version` and optional `artifactId`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will update all dependencies.
# the following example will allow to update foo when version is 1.1.x
#updates.pin  = [ { groupId = "com.example", artifactId="foo", version = "1.1." } ]

# The dependencies which match the given pattern are NOT updated.
#
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, and may have `artifactId` and `version`.
# Defaults to empty `[]` which mean Scala Steward will not ignore dependencies.
#updates.ignore = [ { groupId = "org.acme", artifactId="foo", version = "1.0" } ]

# If set, Scala Steward will only create or update `n` PRs each time it runs (see `pullRequests.frequency` above).
# Useful if running frequently and/or CI build are costly
# Default: None
#updates.limit = 5

# The extensions of files that should be updated.
# Default: [".scala", ".sbt", ".sbt.shared", ".sc", ".yml", "pom.xml"]
#updates.fileExtensions = [".scala", ".sbt", ".sbt.shared", ".sc", ".yml", ".md", ".markdown", ".txt"]

# If "on-conflicts", Scala Steward will update the PR it created to resolve conflicts as
# long as you don't change it yourself.
# If "always", Scala Steward will always update the PR it created as long as
# you don't change it yourself.
# If "never", Scala Steward will never update the PR
# Default: "on-conflicts"
#updatePullRequests = "always" | "on-conflicts" | "never"

# If set, Scala Steward will use this message template for the commit messages and PR titles.
# Supported variables: ${artifactName}, ${currentVersion}, ${nextVersion} and ${default}
# Default: "${default}" which is equivalent to "Update ${artifactName} to ${nextVersion}"
#commits.message = "Update ${artifactName} from ${currentVersion} to ${nextVersion}"

# If true and when upgrading version in .scalafmt.conf, Scala Steward will perform scalafmt
# and add a separate commit when format changed. So you don't need reformat manually and can merge PR.
# If false, Scala Steward will not perform scalafmt, so your CI may abort when reformat needed.
# Default: true
#scalafmt.runAfterUpgrading = false

# It is possible to have multiple scala projects in a single repository. In that case the folders containing the projects (build.sbt folders)
# are specified using the buildRoots property. Note that the paths used there are relative and if the repo directory itself also contains a build.sbt the dot can be used to specify it.
# Default: ["."]
#buildRoots = [ ".", "subfolder/projectA" ]

# Define commands that are executed after an update via a hook.
# A groupId and/or artifactId can be defined to only execute after certain dependencies are updated. If neither is defined, the hook runs for every update.
#postUpdateHooks = [{
#  command = ["sbt", "protobufGenerate"],
#  commitMessage = "Regenerated protobuf files",
#  groupId = "com.github.sbt",
#  artifactId = "sbt-protobuf"
#}]

# You can override some config options for dependencies that matches the given pattern.
# Currently, "pullRequests" can be overridden.
# Each pattern must have `groupId`, and may have `artifactId` and `version`.
# First-matched entry is used.
# More-specific entry should be placed before less-specific entry.
#
# Default: empty `[]`
#dependencyOverrides = [
