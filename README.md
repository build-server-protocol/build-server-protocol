# ![bsp logo](resources/buildServerProtocol64.svg) Build Server Protocol

[![Join the chat on Discord](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/discord?icon=discord&label)](https://discord.gg/7tMENrnv8p)

This project is an effort to improve the integration between language
server/editors and build tools. This effort is led by the [Scala
Center](https://scala.epfl.ch/) and [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/),
together with the help of other tooling developers in the Scala ecosystem and
beyond.

Even though the protocol currently focuses on Scala developer tools, it's
designed to be language-agnostic.

You can read the specification [here](https://build-server-protocol.github.io/docs/specification).

The specification text, docs and support libraries for some of the supported languages are automatically
generated from the [smithy model](spec/src/main/resources/META-INF/smithy/bsp/bsp.smithy).

## Protocol Changelog

### 2.2.0 (Unreleased)

- Add unstable `run/printStdout`, `run/printStderr` and `run/readStdin` notifications
- Add an optional `originId` field to `TaskStartParams`, `TaskProgressParams` and `TaskFinishParams`
  and deprecate it in `CompileReport` and `TestReport` to support BSP clients that need to distinguish
  between multiple reports for the same target.
  - Migration: Use the `originId` field in `TaskFinishParams` instead of `CompileReport`/`TestReport`
    to identify the report.
- Add optional support for environment variables and working directory parameters in `buildTarget/run`
  and `buildTarget/test` requests.
  Mark arguments and environment variables lists in ScalaMainClass and ScalaTestSuites deprecated as
  they are replaced by the parameters in the base request.
- Add `cargo` (Rust build tool) protocol extension
