///
/// * sbt: a build target is a combined project + config. Example:
/// * a regular JVM project with main and test configurations will have 2 build targets, one for main and one for test.
/// * a single configuration in a single project that contains both Java and Scala sources maps to one BuildTarget.
/// * a project with crossScalaVersions 2.11 and 2.12 containing main and test configuration in each will have 4 build targets.
