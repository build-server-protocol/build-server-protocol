This project is a work-in-progress effort to improve the integration
between language server/editors and build tools. This effort is led by the
Scala Center and Jetbrains, together with the help of other tool developers
in the Scala ecosystem.

Even though the protocol focuses on Scala developer tools, it's designed to
be language-agnostic. We're looking for third parties in other programming
languages to join this effort.
